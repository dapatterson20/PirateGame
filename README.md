# PirateGame
My current progress on my pirate game; ship and melee combat implemented.

Download the Word document which contains a link to the Unity Package on Google Drive. Follow this link and download the package to import to Unity.

**Playing the game**

This is a Unity package, so import the package into Unity. There are two scenes to play with, named "The Sea" and "Town." The Town scene is actually two ships where you and your crew can fight against the enemy pirates. To get the full experience, play starting from the Sea scene; if you wish to fight hand to hand, steer your ship into the enemy ship and the other scene will open.

**Controls**

Ships: W to accelerate, S to slow, A and D to turn left and right; you do not need to hold W to keep moving as W adds forward force. To fire, press Z or X to fire a larboard or starboard broadside, and SPACE to fire all cannons at once (only if all cannons are loaded!)

Melee: WASD to move, look around with mouse. Click to attack. Cutlass equipped by default. Equip pistol by pressing 2, and cutlass by pressing 1. There is also a small swivel cannon near you when you start. You can control it by moving to it and pressing F. Press G to unmount. Use WASD to move the cannon around and SPACE to fire. Your allies are in blue and your enemies in red and white.
